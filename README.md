# Lightweight cryptography | CSN11102
This repository includes the work which I have submitted as part of assessment 3 for the CSN11102 e-Security module. This module is tought at Edinburgh Napier University on the Advanced Security and Digital Forensics MSc course.

## Aims
The aim of this project is to compare the speed of a lightweight cryptography cipher in a non-compiled vs compiled language. The cipher that has been selected is the PRESENT cipher, which has been accepted by the international ISO/IEC body in 29192-2:2012. The languages of choice are `python` and `golang`.

## Deliverable
You will find the delivered report (`40210534_CSN11102.pdf`) in this repository. The code folders are used for the testing.
